# Spotify Clone

A Spotify-inspired music streaming UI + demo backend (playlist, search, playback UI).  
Built for learning and demo purposes — *not* a production-grade streaming service.

> Lightweight, responsive, and modular. Ideal for frontend practice (React/Vue/Svelte) or full-stack demos with Node/Express.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React (or Vue / Svelte) + React Router
- TypeScript (optional) or JavaScript
- Zustand / Redux (state) or Context API
- CSS Modules / Tailwind CSS / Styled Components

**Backend (optional)**
- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB / PostgreSQL (optional)
- JWT for session/auth (demo only)

**Tools**
- Vite / Create React App / Next.js
- Axios / Fetch for API calls
- ESLint + Prettier
- Vitest / Jest for testing

---

## Architecture

- `client/` — UI app (React)
- `server/` — API for playlists/auth (optional)
- `shared/` — shared types / mocks
- Uses a service layer for audio playback (encapsulates HTMLAudioElement or Web Playback SDK)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- npm >= 8 or yarn
- (Optional) Spotify Developer account for using Spotify Web API and Web Playback SDK

### Install

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spotify-clone.git
cd spotify-clone

# install client deps
cd client
npm install
# or
yarn

# if there's a server
cd ../server
npm install
```

### Environment variables

Create `.env` files in `client/` and `server/` as needed.

**Example: client/.env**
```
VITE_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
VITE_APP_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173/callback
VITE_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

**Example: server/.env**
```
PORT=4000
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
JWT_SECRET=a-very-secret-key
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/spotify-clone
```

> If you use the Spotify Web API you must register an app at the [Spotify Developer Dashboard] and set redirect URIs correctly.

### Run (development)

Frontend:
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Backend (optional):
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` (or port displayed by your dev server).

### Build & Deploy

Build the client:
```bash
cd client
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Serve static build with your favorite host (Netlify, Vercel, Surge, or serve + Express).

If you have a server, point API URL env var to your deployed backend.

## Extending / Notes

- **Using real Spotify tracks**: You'll likely use the Spotify Web API for metadata and Spotify Web Playback SDK (requires the user to have Spotify Premium and to authorize your app). Read Spotify’s docs for scopes and rate limits.
- **Local demo mode**: If you want to avoid API keys, include a `mocks/` JSON dataset and a toggle `USE_MOCKS=true`.
- **Audio playback**: For demo playback use royalty-free audio files hosted in the project or static server. Full Spotify streaming requires their SDK and policy compliance.
- **Performance**: Lazy-load album art, paginate search results, and debounce search inputs.

---

## Testing

- Unit tests with Vitest/Jest
- Example:
```bash
# client
cd client
npm run test
```

- E2E tests with Playwright or Cypress (optional).
